    Art is a creative activity that expresses imaginative or technical skill. 
    It produces a product, an object. Art is a diverse range of human
    activities in creating visual, performing artifacts, and expressing the 
    author's imaginative mind. The product of art is called a work of art, for 
    others to experience.
    Some art is useful in a practical sense, such as a sculptured clay bowl that 
    can be used. That kind of art is sometimes called a craft.
    Those who make art are called artists. They hope to affect the emotions of
    people who experience it. Some people find art relaxing, exciting or
    informative. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner 
    creativity.
